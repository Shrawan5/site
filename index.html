<!-- PROFILE OVERVIEW -->
<section id="profile">
  <h2>Profile Overview</h2>

  <div class="card profile-text">
    <p>
      I am a media and communication professional with a strong foundation in
      journalism, development communication, and visual storytelling. Holding
      an undergraduate degree in Journalism and Mass Communication, I bring
      over four years of hands-on experience working with non-governmental and
      community-based organizations, where I have contributed as both a
      Program Officer and Communication Officer.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work has focused on designing communication strategies, managing
      digital platforms, documenting impact, and translating complex social
      issues into clear, engaging narratives. Alongside my professional role
      in development, I am an active photographer with experience since 2020,
      using photography as a tool for storytelling, advocacy, and documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I manage and curate content across multiple platforms, including YouTube,
      Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn, strengthening digital engagement and
      audience reach through visual and written communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of media,
      technology, and society. I am particularly interested in exploring how
      emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence can be integrated
      into communication practices, especially within the context of Nepal and
      South Asia. This interest extends to research, digital literacy, and
      youth-focused initiatives aimed at social change and capacity building.
    </p>

    <p>
      Driven by curiosity, creativity, and a commitment to ethical
      communication, I aspire to further my studies in Media and Communication
      Industries at the postgraduate level. My long-term goal is to contribute
      meaningfully to media innovation, research, and development
      communication—bridging theory, practice, and technology to create
      sustainable social impact.
